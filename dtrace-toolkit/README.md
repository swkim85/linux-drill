# The DTrace Toolkit

A set of scripts for use with DTrace on various systems.

The DTrace Toolkit was originally developed by Brendan Gregg and
licensed under the CDDL.  Various people have continued to work on the
scripts in OpenSolaris and its derivatives, FreeBSD and Mac OS X.

Work continues on the toolkit with new scripts being licensed under
the BSD 2-Clause license and modifications to the original scripts
remaining under the CDDL.  **Do NOT change the license on existing
files.**

The **master** branch maintains the original imported scripts and is
not to be modified.  Each Operating System has its own branch
(illumos, freebsd, macos) on which OS specific changes are to be maintained.
